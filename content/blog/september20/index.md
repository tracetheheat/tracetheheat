The bizzare season is about to peak soon without being sure if the races are about to happen or not.

Without having too much starts this year, I'm glad I've managed to quickly register for semi-trail half-marathon back in September. And it was amazing!

Small local race. Fast start with flat first 8km followed by 7km mid-part steadily going up and ended with 6km downhill/flat. The truck was just stunning!

I've managed to stick to my strategy and start the race till first uphill somewhere around 3:50-3:55 min/km. This tempo turned out to be just fine for running at 3th/4th position. The first two runners were running deep under 3:50, so I wasn't even trying to get there and was focusing on not pushing it too hard to save something for the uphill/downhill part. 

**This part was hard, crucial and funny.** The road was turning to trail features and back, so the middle part was quite fast. I've been still able to keep my 3th/4th position and was already thinking about the perfect timing to save the 3rd spot.

The breaking point was right before the downhill, where I've managed to make a fast escape. Even though the descent was speedy and it felt like flying, unfortunately, I didn't make it to keep sub 4:00 tempo during the last 2-3km. I just didn't have it to push it under. More experienced and 20 years older runner just gave me the lesson and took third place. This means that my 1h 29min was just fine for 4th open and 1st in my age category with 5 minutes reserve to the second guy.

For the next, I have to keep in mind that downhills are as crucial as uphills and that instead of trying to escape before, I should keep it for the very last part.

This race was not important because I've ended up at the top of the finish list, but because it showed me the gaps in my running. Running with an older and experienced runner is the best training, and I'm pleased that I could keep the tempo with them. I just hope, that in 20 years I will be one of these "old" sporty guys knowing what it takes to score.

Half-marathon gave me the trust to try my best in the upcoming race. Let's just hope nothing will be postponed or delayed. And if so, I could already say that this season gave me an important lesson.
